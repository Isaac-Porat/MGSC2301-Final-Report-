Problem 1:
- [x] Develop numerical summary of the data:
- Provide Descriptive Statistics of both random variables (X) and (Y)

Problem 2:
- [x] Develop a Scatter Diagram showing the relationship between X and Y
- What does the scatter diagram indicate about a relationship between the X and Y?

Problem 3:
- [x] Introduce one (or more) control variables.
- Provide Descriptive Statistics for the control variable(s).

Problem 4:
- [x] Run regression model and provide ANOVA Output Tables:
- Develop the estimated regression equation by using the values of b0 and b1
- Report SSE, SST, and SSR
- Report the coefficient of determination R2. Comment on the goodness of fit.

Problem 5:
- [x] Use the t test to test for significant relationship. Use α = 0.05
- What is your conclusion: present and discuss your findings?

Problem 6:
- [x] Compute the F value, and test for significance. Use α = 0.05. 
- What is your conclusion: present and discuss your findings?

Problem 7:
- [x] Pick a random value(s) for X within the range of your data:
- Build a 95% confidence and prediction intervals for E(yp) and yp
